# Kinnaird-Clone

This is my clone. There will be some overlap between this and [cheatsheets.kmcquade.com](https://cheatsheets.kmcquade.com/). However, that one is simply for stashing commands and easy editing via GitBook.io, whereas this one will be for stashing actual files/configs, writeups, etc.


General contents:
* dotfiles
* .scripts folder contains some quick scripts that I run from time to time, mostly cleanup related
* `.aws/` folder has some AWS related scripts
* `.cheat/` folder has some command specific cheatsheets
* `.templates/` has some Jetbrains Live Templates / VSCode equivalents
